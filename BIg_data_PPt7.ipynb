A replica set consists of multiple MongoDB instances, where one instance acts as the primary node and the others act as secondary nodes.

If the primary node becomes unavailable, one of the secondary nodes automatically gets promoted to become the new primary node.\n",

Data is distributed across multiple nodes using a partitioning strategy, ensuring that each node is responsible for a specific range of data.\n",

        "Replication: Cassandra replicates data across multiple nodes using configurable replication factors. Each data item is replicated to multiple nodes in different geographical locations or data centers, providing fault tolerance and enabling data availability even if some nodes fail.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consistent Hashing: Cassandra uses consistent hashing to distribute data evenly across the cluster. This allows for the addition or removal of nodes without requiring a full data redistribution, ensuring minimal impact on the system's availability.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Replication Strategy: Cassandra supports multiple data replication strategies, such as SimpleStrategy and NetworkTopologyStrategy. These strategies define how data is replicated across nodes and data centers. NetworkTopologyStrategy enables replication based on data center placement, ensuring fault tolerance in case of data center failures.\n",
        "\n",
        "Gossip Protocol: Cassandra uses a gossip protocol for node discovery, failure detection, and cluster state propagation. Nodes periodically exchange information about themselves and other nodes in the cluster, enabling efficient detection of node failures and ensuring consistent cluster status across all nodes.\n",

        "   a. Describe the concept of indexing in MongoDB and its importance in query optimization. Write a Python program that creates an index on a specific field in a MongoDB collection and executes a query using that index.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Ans.\n",
        "  Indexing in MongoDB is the process of creating an index data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations, such as queries, by enabling efficient access to specific fields or combinations of fields in a collection. Indexes are stored in a separate data structure that allows MongoDB to quickly locate and retrieve documents that match the query criteria.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some key points regarding indexing in MongoDB and its importance in query optimization:\n",
        "\n",
        "Index Structure: MongoDB supports various types of indexes, including single-field indexes, compound indexes, multi-key indexes, geospatial indexes, and text indexes. Each index type is designed to efficiently handle different query patterns and data types.\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Query Performance: Indexes facilitate faster query execution by reducing the number of documents that need to be examined. Instead of scanning the entire collection, MongoDB can use the index to identify a subset of documents that match the query conditions, significantly improving query performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Selectivity: An important aspect of indexing is the selectivity of an index. A highly selective index filters out a large portion of the documents, leading to faster query execution. On the other hand, a less selective index may still improve query performance but might not provide as significant gains.\n",
        "\n",
        "Considerations for Indexing: While indexing enhances query performance, it also has trade-offs. Indexes consume storage space and require additional resources for maintenance during write operations. Therefore, it's crucial to create indexes selectively based on the application's query patterns and performance requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's write a Python program that creates an index on a specific field in a MongoDB collection and executes a query using that index:\n",
